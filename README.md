Agentic AI with openai SDK, CrewAI, AutoGen and MCP

## OpenAI SDK

There are 3 steps to get started with the OpenAI SDK:
1. Create an Agent Instance
2. To track the agent progress, use 'with trace()' context manager
3. Run the agent with 'runner.run()'


> **Info:**  
> The 3 simple terminologies used in the OpenAI SDK are:  
> - **Agent:** An agent is an entity that can perceive its environment through observations and act upon.  
> - **Handoff:** A handoff is a mechanism that allows an agent to delegate a task or responsibility to another agent or system.  
> - **Guardrail:** A guardrail is a safety mechanism or constraint that is put in place to prevent an agent from taking actions that could lead to undesirable outcomes.
